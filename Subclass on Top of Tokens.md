# A `Task` Subclass on top of Cancel Tokens

As a base we take the ideas from:

- "Subclass Brainstorming", which itself is based on "Third State"
- [zenparsing/es-cancel-token](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-cancel-token), plus the modifications described in [#4](https://github.com/zenparsing/es-cancel-token/issues/4) over there for integration with "Third State"

The idea is to see if we can produce the semantics from "Subclass Brainstorming" on top of the cancel token design.

Hmm, maybe this is better done in source code.
